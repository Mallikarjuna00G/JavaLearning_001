## SelfTest02

### SelfTest Problem

Even though console input and output is text-­based, why does Java still use byte streams for this purpose?

### SelfTest Solution

## SelfTest06

### SelfTest Problem

How can you convert a numeric string such as "123.23" into its binary equivalent?

### SelfTest Solution



---
---

## SelfTest07

### SelfTest Problem

Write a program that copies a text file. In the process, have it convert all spaces into hyphens. Use the byte stream file classes. Use the traditional approach to closing a file by explicitly calling `close()`.

### SelfTest Solution



---
---

## SelfTest08

### SelfTest Problem

Rewrite the program described in question 7 so that it uses the character stream classes. This time, use the `try­`-with-­resources statement to automatically close the file.

### SelfTest Solution

## SelfTest09

### SelfTest Problem

What type of stream is `System.in`?

### SelfTest Solution

## SelfTest10

### SelfTest Problem

What does the `read()` method of `InputStream` return when an attempt is made to read at the end of the stream?

### SelfTest Solution

## SelfTest11

### SelfTest Problem

What type of stream is used to read binary data?

### SelfTest Solution



---

## SelfTest12

### SelfTest Problem

`Reader` and `Writer` are at the top of the ____________ class hierarchies.

### SelfTest Solution

## SelfTest13

### SelfTest Problem

The `try­`-with-­resources statement is used for ___________________________________.

### SelfTest Solution

## SelfTest14

### SelfTest Problem

If you are using the traditional method of closing a file, then closing a file within a `finally` block is generally a good approach. True or False?

### SelfTest Solution

## SelfTest15

### SelfTest Problem

Can local variable type inference be used when declaring the resource in a `try­`-with­-resources statement?
