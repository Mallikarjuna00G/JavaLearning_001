### SelfTest Problem

The complement of a queue is a stack. It uses first­-in, last-­out accessing and is often likened to a stack of plates. The first plate put on the table is the last plate used. Create a stack class called `Stack` that can hold characters. Call the methods that access the stack `push()` and `pop()`. Allow the user to specify the size of the stack when it is created. Keep all other members of the `Stack` class `private`. (*Hint:* You can use the `Queue` class as a model; just change the way the data is accessed.)
