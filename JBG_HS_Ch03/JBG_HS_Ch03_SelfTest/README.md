### SelfTest Problem

Given

```java
if(x < 10)
    if(y > 100) {
        if(!done) x = z;
        else y = z;
    }
else System.out.println("error");  // what if?
```

to what `if` does the last `else` associate?

for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    while(running) {
        if(x < y) break;
            // ...
    }
    System.out.println("after while");
}
System.out.println("After for");

## SelfTest08

### SelfTest Problem

What does the following fragment print?

```java
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.print(i + " ");
    if((i % 2) == 0) continue;
    System.out.println();
}
```

## SelfTest09

### SelfTest Problem

The iteration expression in a `for` loop need not always alter the loop control variable by a fixed amount. Instead, the loop control variable can change in any arbitrary way. Using this concept, write a program that uses a `for` loop to generate and display the progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on.

### SelfTest Solution

#### Programs:

[]()

AAA

#### Execution Logs

```

```

## SelfTest10

### SelfTest Problem

The ASCII lowercase letters are separated from the uppercase letters by 32. Thus, to convert a lowercase letter to uppercase, subtract 32 from it. Use this information to write a program that reads characters from the keyboard. Have it convert all lowercase letters to uppercase, and all uppercase letters to lowercase, displaying the result. Make no changes to any other character. Have the program stop when the user enters a period. At the end, have the program display the number of case changes that have taken place.

### SelfTest Solution

[]()

AAA

## SelfTest12

### SelfTest Problem

When using `break` with a label, must the label be on a block that contains the `break`?

### SelfTest Solution

#### Programs:
