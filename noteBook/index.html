                        <p>The purpose of this book is to teach you the fundamentals of Java programming. It uses a step-by-step approach complete with numerous examples, self tests, and projects. It assumes no previous programming experience. The book starts with the basics, such as how to compile and run a Java program. It then discusses the keywords, features, and constructs that form the core of the Java language. You'll also find coverage of some of Java's most advanced features, including multithreaded programming, generics, lambda expressions, and modules. An introduction to the fundamentals of Swing concludes the book. By the time you finish, you will have a firm grasp of the essentials of Java programming.</p>
                        <p>It is important to state at the outset that this book is just a starting point. Java is more than just the elements that define the language. Java also includes extensive libraries and tools that aid in the development of programs. To be a top-notch Java programmer implies mastery of these areas, too. After completing this book, you will have the knowledge to pursue any and all other aspects of Java.</p>

                        </div>  <!-- left -->
                        <div class="right">
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Only a few languages have fundamentally reshaped the very essence of programming. In this elite group, one stands out because its impact was both rapid and widespread. This language is, of course, Java. It is not an overstatement to say that the original release of Java 1.0 in 1995 by <strong>Sun Microsystems, Inc.</strong>, caused a revolution in programming. This revolution radically transformed the Web into a highly interactive environment. In the process, Java set a new standard in computer language design.</p>
                                <p>Over the years, Java has continued to grow, evolve, and otherwise redefine itself. Unlike many other languages, which are slow to incorporate new features, Java has often been at the forefront of computer language development. One reason for this is the culture of innovation and change that came to surround Java. As a result, Java has gone through several upgrades—some relatively small, others more significant.</p>
                                <p>The first major update to Java was version 1.1. The features added by Java 1.1 were more substantial than the increase in the minor revision number would have you think. For example, Java 1.1 added many new library elements, redefined the way events are handled, and reconfigured many features of the original 1.0 library.</p>
                                <p>The next major release of Java was Java 2, where the 2 indicates "second generation." The creation of Java 2 was a watershed event, marking the beginning of Java's "modern age." The first release of Java 2 carried the version number 1.2. It may seem odd that the first release of Java 2 used the 1.2 version number. The reason is that it originally referred to the internal version number of the Java libraries but then was generalized to refer to the entire release itself. With Java 2, Sun repackaged the Java product as J2SE (Java 2 Platform Standard Edition), and the version numbers began to be applied to that product.</p>
                                <p>The next upgrade of Java was J2SE 1.3. This version of Java was the first major upgrade to the original Java 2 release. For the most part, it added to existing functionality and "tightened up" the development environment. The release of J2SE 1.4 further enhanced Java. This release contained several important new features, including chained exceptions, channel-based I/O, and the <code>assert</code> keyword.</p>
                                <p>The release of J2SE 5 created nothing short of a second Java revolution. Unlike most of the previous Java upgrades, which offered important but incremental improvements, J2SE 5 fundamentally expanded the scope, power, and range of the language. To give you an idea of the magnitude of the changes caused by J2SE 5, here is a list of its major new features:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Generics</li>
                                        <li>Autoboxing/unboxing</li>
                                        <li>Enumerations</li>
                                        <li>The enhanced "for-each" style <code>for</code> loop</li>
                                        <li>Variable-length arguments (varargs)</li>
                                        <li>Static import</li>
                                        <li>Annotations</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>This is not a list of minor tweaks or incremental upgrades. Each item in the list represents a significant addition to the Java language. Some, such as generics, the enhanced <code>for</code> loop, and varargs, introduced new syntax elements. Others, such as autoboxing and auto-unboxing, altered the semantics of the language. Annotations added an entirely new dimension to programming.</p>
                                <p>The importance of these new features is reflected in the use of the version number "5." The next version number for Java would normally have been 1.5. However, the new features were so significant that a shift from 1.4 to 1.5 just didn't seem to express the magnitude of the change. Instead, Sun elected to increase the version number to 5 as a way of emphasizing that a major event was taking place. Thus, it was named J2SE 5, and the Java Development Kit (JDK) was called JDK 5. In order to maintain consistency, however, Sun decided to use 1.5 as its <em>internal version</em> number, which is also referred to as the <em>developer version</em> number. The "5" in J2SE 5 is called the <em>product version</em> number.</p>
                                <p>The next release of Java was called Java SE 6, and Sun once again decided to change the name of the Java platform. First, notice that the "2" has been dropped. Thus, the platform now had the name Java SE, and the official product name was Java Platform, Standard Edition 6, with the development kit being called JDK 6. As with J2SE 5, the 6 in Java SE 6 is the <em>product version</em> number. The internal, <em>developer version</em> number is 1.6.</p>
                                <p>Java SE 6 built on the base of J2SE 5, adding incremental improvements. Java SE 6 added no major features to the Java language proper, but it did enhance the API libraries, added several new packages, and offered improvements to the run time. It also went through several updates during its long (in Java terms) life cycle, with several upgrades added along the way. In general, Java SE 6 served to further solidify the advances made by J2SE 5.</p>
                                <p>The next release of Java was called Java SE 7, with the development kit being called JDK 7. It has an internal version number of 1.7. Java SE 7 was the first major release of Java after <strong>Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle</strong>. Java SE 7 added several new features, including significant additions to the language and the API libraries. Some of the most important features added by Java SE 7 were those developed as part of <em>Project Coin</em>. The purpose of Project Coin was to identify a number of small changes to the Java language that would be incorporated into JDK 7, including
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A <code>String</code> can control a <code>switch</code> statement.</li>
                                        <li>Binary integer literals.</li>
                                        <li>Underscores in numeric literals.</li>
                                        <li>An expanded <code>try</code> statement, called <code>try</code><i>-with-resources</i>, that supports automatic resource management.</li>
                                        <li>Type inference (via the diamond operator) when constructing a generic instance.</li>
                                        <li>Enhanced exception handling in which two or more exceptions can be caught by a single catch (multi-catch) and better type checking for exceptions that are rethrown.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>As you can see, even though the Project Coin features were considered to be small changes to the language, their benefits were much larger than the qualifier "small" would suggest. In particular, the <code>try</code><i>-with-resources</i> statement profoundly affects the way that a substantial amount of code is written.</p>
                                <p>The next release of Java was Java SE 8, with the development kit being called JDK 8. It has an internal version number of 1.8. JDK 8 represented a very significant upgrade to the Java language because of the inclusion of a far-reaching new language feature: the <i><b>lambda expression</b></i>. The impact of lambda expressions was, and continues to be, quite profound, changing both the way that programming solutions are conceptualized and how Java code is written. In the process, lambda expressions can simplify and reduce the amount of source code needed to create certain constructs. The addition of lambda expressions also caused a new operator (the <code>-></code>) and a new syntax element to be added to the language. In addition to lambda expressions, JDK 8 added many other important new features. For example, beginning with JDK 8, it is now possible to define a default implementation for a method specified by an interface. In the final analysis, Java SE 8 was a major release that profoundly expanded the capabilities of the language and changed the way that Java code is written.</p>
                                <p>The next release of Java was Java SE 9. The developer's kit was called JDK 9. With the release of JDK 9, the internal version number is also 9. JDK 9 represented a major Java release, incorporating significant enhancements to both the Java language and its libraries. The primary new feature was <b>modules</b>, which enable you to specify the relationships and dependencies of the code that comprises an application. Modules also add another dimension to Java's access control features. The inclusion of modules caused a new syntax element, several new keywords, and various tool enhancements to be added to Java. Modules had a profound effect on the API library because, beginning with JDK 9, the library packages are now organized into modules.</p>
                                <p>In addition to modules, JDK 9 included several other new features. One of particular interest is <b>JShell</b>, which is a tool that supports interactive program experimentation and learning. (An introduction to JShell is found in <i>Appendix D</i>.) Another interesting upgrade is support for <i>private interface methods</i>. Their inclusion further enhanced JDK 8's support for default methods in interfaces. JDK 9 added a search feature to the <b>javadoc</b> tool and a new tag called <code>@index</code> to support it. As with previous releases, JDK 9 contains a number of updates and enhancements to Java's API libraries.</p>
                                <p>As a general rule, in any Java release, it is the new features that receive the most attention. However, there is one high-profile aspect of Java that was <i>deprecated by JDK 9: applets</i>. <strong>Beginning with JDK 9, applets are no longer recommended for new projects</strong>. As will be explained in greater detail in Chapter 1, because of waning browser support for applets (and other factors), JDK 9 deprecated the entire applet API.</p>
                                <p>The next release of Java was Java SE 10 (JDK 10). However, prior to its release, a major change occurred in the Java release schedule. In the past, major releases were often separated by two or more years. However, beginning with JDK 10, the time between releases was significantly shortened. Releases are now expected to occur on a strict time-based schedule, with the anticipated time between major releases (now called <i>feature releases</i>) to be just six months. As a result, JDK 10 was released in March 2018, which is six months after the release of JDK 9. This more rapid <b>release cadence</b> enables new features and improvements to be quickly available to Java programmers. Instead of waiting two or more years, when a new feature is ready, it becomes part of the next scheduled release.</p>
                                <p>The primary new language feature added by JDK 10 was support for <em>local variable type inference</em>. With local variable type inference, it is now possible to let the type of a local variable be inferred from the type of its initializer, rather than being explicitly specified. To support this new capability, the context-sensitive identifier <code>var</code> was added to Java as a reserved type name. Type inference can streamline code by eliminating the need to redundantly specify a variable's type when it can be inferred from its initializer. It can also simplify declarations in cases in which the type is difficult to discern or cannot be explicitly specified. Local variable type inference has become a common part of the contemporary programming environment. Its inclusion in Java helps keep Java up-to-date with evolving trends in language design. Along with a number of other changes, JDK 10 also redefined the Java version string, changing the meaning of the version numbers so they better align with the new time-based release schedule.</p>
                                <p><span class="highlight">At the time of this writing, the latest version of Java is Java SE 11 (JDK 11). It was released in September 2018</span>, which is six months after JDK 10. The primary new language feature in JDK 11 is its support for the use of <code>var</code> in a lambda expression. Also, another execution mode was added to the Java launcher that enables it to directly execute simple single-file programs. JDK 11 also removes some features. Perhaps of greatest interest, because of its historical significance, is the removal of support for applets. Recall that applets were first deprecated by JDK 9. <span class="highlight">With the release of JDK 11, applet support has been removed</span>. Support for another deployment-related technology called <em>Java Web Start</em> has also been removed from JDK 11. There is one other <em>high-profile removal in JDK 11: JavaFX</em>. This GUI framework is no longer part of the JDK, becoming a separate open-source project instead. Because these features have been removed from the JDK, they are not discussed in this book.</p>
                                <p>One other point about the evolution of Java: Beginning in 2006, the process of open-sourcing Java began. Today, open-source implementations of the JDK are available. Open sourcing further contributes to the dynamic nature of Java development. In the final analysis, Java's legacy of innovation is secure. Java remains the vibrant, nimble language that the programming world has come to expect.</p>
                                <p><span class="highlight">The material in this book has been updated through <strong>JDK 11</strong></span>. As the preceding discussion has highlighted, however, the history of Java programming is marked by dynamic change. As you advance in your study of Java, you will want to watch for new features of each subsequent Java release. Simply put: The evolution of Java continues!</p>

                        <p>In computing, few technologies have had the impact of Java. Its creation in the early days of the Web helped shape the modern form of the Internet, including both the client and server sides. Its innovative features advanced the art and science of programming, setting a new standard in computer language design. The forward-thinking culture that grew up around Java ensured it would remain vibrant and alive, adapting to the often rapid and varied changes in the computing landscape. Simply put: not only is Java one of the world's most important computer languages, it is a force that revolutionized programming and, in the process, changed the world.</p>
                        <p>Although Java is a language often associated with Internet programming, it is by no means limited in that regard. Java is a powerful, full-featured, general-purpose programming language. Thus, if you are new to programming, Java is an excellent language to learn. Moreover, to be a professional programmer today implies the ability to program in Java—it is that important. In the course of this book, you will learn the basic skills that will help you master it.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to Java, beginning with its history, its design philosophy, and several of its most important features. By far, the hardest thing about learning a programming language is the fact that no element exists in isolation. Instead, the components of the language work in conjunction with each other. This interrelatedness is especially pronounced in Java. In fact, it is difficult to discuss one aspect of Java without involving others. To help overcome this problem, this chapter provides a brief overview of several Java features, including the general form of a Java program, some basic control structures, and simple operators. It does not go into too many details, but, rather, concentrates on general concepts common to any Java program.</p>

                                <p>Before one can fully appreciate the unique aspects of Java, it is necessary to understand the forces that drove its creation, the programming philosophy that it embodies, and key concepts of its design. As you advance through this book, you will see that many aspects of Java are either a direct or indirect result of the historical forces that shaped the language. Thus, it is fitting that we begin our examination of Java by exploring how Java relates to the larger programming universe.</p>

                                        <p>Somewhat surprisingly, the original impetus for Java was not the Internet! Instead, the <span class="highlight">primary motivation was the need for a platform-independent language</span> that could be used to create software to be embedded in various consumer electronic devices, such as toasters, microwave ovens, and remote controls. As you can probably guess, many different types of CPUs are used as controllers. The trouble was that (at the time) most computer languages were designed to be compiled into machine code that was targeted for a specific type of CPU. For example, consider the C++ language.</p>
                                        <p>Although it was possible to compile a C++ program for just about any type of CPU, to do so required a full C++ compiler targeted for that CPU. The problem, however, is that compilers are expensive and time consuming to create. In an attempt to find a better solution, Gosling and the others worked on a portable, cross-platform language that could produce code that would run on a variety of CPUs under differing environments. <span class="highlight">This effort ultimately led to the creation of Java</span>.</p>
                                        <p>About the time that the details of Java were being worked out, a second, and ultimately more important, factor emerged that would play a crucial role in the future of Java. This second force was, of course, the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>. <span class="highlight">Had the Web not taken shape at about the same time that Java was being implemented, Java might have remained a useful but obscure language for programming consumer electronics</span>. However, with the emergence of the Web, Java was propelled to the forefront of computer language design, because the Web, too, demanded portable programs.</p>
                                        <p>Most programmers learn early in their careers that portable programs are as elusive as they are desirable. While the quest for a way to create efficient, portable (platform-independent) programs is nearly as old as the discipline of programming itself, it had taken a back seat to other, more pressing problems. However, with the advent of the Internet and the Web, the old problem of portability returned with a vengeance. After all, the Internet consisted of a diverse, distributed universe populated with many types of computers, operating systems, and CPUs.</p>
                                        <p>What was once an irritating but low-priority problem had become a high-profile necessity. By 1993 it became obvious to members of the Java design team that the problems of portability frequently encountered when creating code for embedded controllers are also found when attempting to create code for the Internet. This realization caused the focus of Java to switch from consumer electronics to Internet programming. So, although it was the desire for an architecture-neutral programming language that provided the initial spark, it was the Internet that ultimately led to Java's large-scale success.</p>

                                        <p>The history of computer languages is not one of isolated events. Rather, it is a continuum in which each new language is influenced in one way or another by what has come before. In this regard, Java is no exception. Before moving on, it is useful to understand where Java fits into the family tree of computer languages.</p>
                                        <p>The two languages that form Java's closest ancestors are C and C++. As you may know, C and C++ are among the most important computer languages ever invented and are still in widespread use today. <span class="highlight">From <code>C</code>, Java inherits its syntax. Java's object model is adapted from <code>C++</code></span>. Java's relationship to C and C++ is important for a number of reasons. First, at the time of Java's creation, many programmers were familiar with the C/C++ syntax. Because Java uses a similar syntax, it was relatively easy for a C/C++ programmer to learn Java. This made it possible for Java to be readily utilized by the pool of existing programmers, thus facilitating Java's acceptance by the programming community.</p>
                                        <p>Second, Java's designers did not "reinvent the wheel." Instead, they further refined an already highly successful programming paradigm. The modern age of programming began with C. It moved to C++ and then to Java. By inheriting and building on that rich heritage, Java provides a powerful, logically consistent programming environment that takes the best of the past and adds new features related to the online environment and advances in the art of programming. Perhaps most important, because of their similarities, C, C++, and Java define a common, conceptual framework for the professional programmer. Programmers do not face major rifts when switching from one language to another.</p>
                                        <p>Java has another attribute in common with C and C++: it was designed, tested, and refined by real working programmers. It is a language grounded in the needs and experiences of the people who devised it. There is no better way to produce a top-flight professional programming language.</p>
                                        <p>One last point: although C++ and Java are related, especially in their support for object-oriented programming, Java is not simply the "Internet version of C++." Java has significant practical and philosophical differences from C++. Furthermore, Java is not an enhanced version of C++. For example, it is neither upwardly nor downwardly compatible with C++. Moreover, Java was not designed to replace C++. Java was designed to solve a certain set of problems. C++ was designed to solve a different set of problems. They will coexist for many years to come.</p>

                                        <p class="answer">A few years after the creation of Java, Microsoft developed the C# language. This is important because C# is closely related to Java. In fact, many of C#'s features directly parallel Java. Both Java and C# share the same general C++-style syntax, support distributed programming, and utilize a similar object model. There are, of course, differences between Java and C#, but the overall "look and feel" of these languages is very similar. This means that if you already know C#, then learning Java will be especially easy. Conversely, if C# is in your future, then your knowledge of Java will come in handy.</p>

First, the creation of Java simplified Internet programming in general, acting as a catalyst that drew legions of programmers to the Web. Second, Java innovated a new type of networked program called the <strong>applet</strong> that changed the way the online world thought about content.

Arguably the most important is found in its ability to create portable, cross-platform programs. Of nearly equal importance is Java's support for networking. Its library of ready-to-use functionality enabled programmers to easily write programs that accessed or made use of the Internet. It also provided mechanisms that enabled programs to be readily delivered over the Internet. Although the details are beyond the scope of this book, it is sufficient to know that Java's support for networking was a key factor in its rapid rise.</p>

                                                <p>At the time of Java's creation, one of its most exciting features was the applet. An applet is a special kind of Java program that is designed to be transmitted over the Internet and automatically executed inside a Java-compatible web browser. If the user clicks a link that contains an applet, the applet will download and run in the browser automatically. Applets were intended to be small programs, typically used to display data provided by the server, handle user input, or provide simple functions, such as a loan calculator. The key feature of applets is that they execute locally, rather than on the server. In essence, the applet allowed some functionality to be moved from the server to the client.</p>
                                                <p>The creation of the applet was important because, at the time, it expanded the universe of objects that could move about freely in cyberspace. In general, there are two very broad categories of objects that are transmitted between the server and the client: <i>passive information</i> and <i>dynamic active programs</i>. For example, when you read your e-mail, you are viewing passive data. Even when you download a program, the program's code is still only passive data until you execute it. By contrast, the applet is a dynamic, self-executing program. Such a program is an active agent on the client computer, yet it is delivered by the server.</p>
                                                <p>In the early days of Java, applets were a crucial part of Java programming. They illustrated the power and benefits of Java, added an exciting dimension to web pages, and enabled programmers to explore the full extent of what was possible with Java. Although it is likely that there are still applets in use today, over time they became less important, and for reasons that will be explained shortly, JDK 9 began their phase-out process. Finally, applet support was removed by JDK 11.</p>

                                                <p>As desirable as dynamic, networked programs are, they also present serious problems in the areas of security and portability. Obviously, a program that downloads and  executes on the client computer must be prevented from doing harm. It must also be able to run in a variety of different environments and under different operating systems. As you will see, Java addressed these problems in an effective and elegant way. Let's look a bit more closely at each, beginning with security.</p>
                                                <p>As you are likely aware, every time that you download a program, you are taking a risk because the code you are downloading might contain a virus, Trojan horse, or other harmful code. At the core of the problem is the fact that malicious code can cause damage because it has gained unauthorized access to system resources. For example, a virus program might gather private information, such as credit card numbers, bank account balances, and passwords, by searching the contents of your computer's local file system. In order for Java to enable programs to be safely downloaded and executed on the client computer, it was necessary to prevent them from launching such an attack.</p>
                                                <p>Java achieved this protection by enabling you to <span class="highlight">confine an application to the Java execution environment and prevent it from accessing other parts of the computer</span>. (You will see how this is accomplished shortly.) The ability to download an application with a high level of confidence that no harm will be done contributed significantly to Java's early success.</p>

                                        <p>The key that allowed Java to address both the security and the portability problems just described is that <span class="highlight">the output of a Java compiler is not executable code. Rather, it is bytecode</span>. <b>Bytecode</b> is a highly optimized set of instructions designed to be executed by what is called the <em>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</em>, which is part of the <em>Java RuntimeEnvironment (JRE)</em>. In essence, the original JVM was designed as an interpreter for bytecode. This may come as a bit of a surprise because many modern languages are designed to be compiled into CPU-specific, executable code due to performance concerns. However, the fact that a Java program is executed by the JVM helps solve the major problems associated with web-based programs. Here is why.</p>
                                        <p>Translating a Java program into bytecode makes it much easier to run a program in a wide variety of environments because only the JRE (which includes the JVM) needs to be implemented for each platform. Once a JRE exists for a given system, any Java program can run on it. Remember, although the details of the JRE will differ from platform to platform, all JREs understand the same Java bytecode. If a Java program were compiled to native code, then different versions of the same program would have to exist for each type of CPU connected to the Internet. This is, of course, not a feasible solution. Thus, the execution of bytecode by the JVM is the easiest way to create truly portable programs.</p>
                                        <p>The fact that a Java program is executed by the JVM also helps to make it secure. Because the JVM is in control, it manages program execution. Thus, it is possible for the JVM to create a restricted execution environment, called the <em>sandbox</em>, that contains the program, preventing unrestricted access to the machine. Safety is also enhanced by certain restrictions that exist in the Java language.</p>
                                        <p>When a program is interpreted, it generally runs slower than the same program would run if compiled to executable code. However, with Java, the differential between the two is not so great. Because bytecode has been highly optimized, the use of bytecode enables the JVM to execute programs much faster than you might expect.</p>
                                        <p>Although Java was designed as an interpreted language, there is nothing about Java that prevents on-the-fly compilation of bytecode into native code in order to boost performance. For this reason, the <em>HotSpot JVM</em> was introduced not long after Java's initial release. <span class="highlight">HotSpot includes a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for bytecode</span>. When a JIT compiler is part of the JVM, selected portions of bytecode are compiled into executable code in real time on a piece-by-piece demand basis. That is, a JIT compiler compiles code as it is needed during execution. Furthermore, not all sequences of bytecode are compiled—only those that will benefit from compilation. The remaining code is simply interpreted. However, the just-in-time approach still yields a significant performance boost. Even when dynamic compilation is applied to bytecode, the portability and safety features still apply because the JVM is still in charge of the execution environment.</p>
                                        <p>One other point: Beginning with JDK 9, some Java environments will also support an ahead-of-time compiler that can be used to compile bytecode into native code prior to execution by the JVM, rather than on-the-fly. <em>Ahead-of-time compilation</em> is a specialized feature and it does not replace Java's traditional approach just described. Because of the highly sophisticated nature of ahead-of-time compilation, it is not something that you will use when learning Java, and it is <i>not</i> discussed further in this book.</p>

                                        <p class="answer">A Java servlet is a small program that executes on a server. Servlets dynamically extend the functionality of a web server. It is helpful to understand that as useful as client-side applications can be, they are just one half of the client/server equation. Not long after the initial release of Java, it became obvious that Java would also be useful on the server side. The result was the servlet. Thus, with the advent of the servlet, Java spanned both sides of the client/server connection. Although the topic of servlets, and server-side programming in general, is beyond the scope of this beginner's guide, they are something that you will likely find of interest as you advance in Java programming.</p>

                                        <p>At the time of this writing, it has been more than two decades since Java's original release. Over those years, many changes have taken place. At the time of Java's creation, the Internet was a new and exciting innovation; web browsers were undergoing rapid development and refinement; the modern form of the smartphone had not yet been invented; and the near ubiquitous use of computers was still a few years off. As you would expect, Java has also changed and so, too, has the way that Java is used. Perhaps nothing illustrates the ongoing evolution of Java better than the applet.</p>
                                        <p>As explained previously, in the early years of Java, applets were a crucial part of Java programming. They not only added excitement to a web page, they were a highly visible part of Java, which added to its charisma. However, applets rely on a Java browser plug-in. Thus, for an applet to work, it must be supported by the browser. Recently,support for the Java browser plug-in has been waning. Simply put, without browser support, applets are not viable. Because of this, beginning with JDK 9, the phase-out of applets was begun, with support for applets being deprecated. In the language of Java, deprecated means that a feature is still available but flagged as obsolete. Thus, a deprecated feature should not be used for new code. The phase-out became complete <span class="highlight">with the release of JDK 11 because support for applets was removed</span>.</p>
                                        <p>As a point of interest, a few years after Java's creation an alternative to applets was added. Called <b>Java Web Start</b>, it enabled an application to be dynamically downloaded from a web page. It was a deployment mechanism that was especially useful for larger Java applications that were not appropriate for applets. The difference between an applet and a Web Start application is that a Web Start application runs on its own, not inside the browser. Thus, it looks much like a "normal" application. It does, however, require that a stand-alone JRE that supports Web Start is available on the host system. <span class="highlight">Beginning with JDK 11, support for Java Web Start has been removed</span>.</p>
                                        <p>Given that neither applets nor Java Web Start are viable options for modern versions of Java, you might wonder what mechanism should be used to deploy a Java application. At the time of this writing, one part of the answer is to use the <b>jlink</b> tool added by JDK 9. It can create a complete run-time image that includes all necessary support for your program, including the JRE. As you might guess, deployment is a rather advanced topic that is outside the scope of this book. Fortunately, you won't need to worry about deployment to use this book because all of the sample programs run directly on your computer. They are not deployed over the Internet.</p>

                                        <p>Another major change has recently occurred in Java, but it does not involve changes to the language or the run-time environment. Rather, it relates to the way that Java releases are scheduled. In the past, major Java releases were typically separated by two or more years. However, subsequent to the release of JDK 9, the time between major Java releases has been decreased. Today, it is anticipated that a major release will occur on a strict time-based schedule, with the expected time between major releases being just six months.</p>
                                        <p>Each major release, now called a <em>feature release</em>, will include those features ready at the time of the release. This increased <i>release cadence</i> enables new features and enhancements to be available to Java programmers in a timely fashion. Furthermore, it allows Java to respond quickly to the demands of an ever-changing programming environment. Simply put, the faster release schedule promises to be a very positive development for Java programmers.</p>
                                        <p>Currently, feature releases are scheduled for March and September of each year. As a result, JDK 10 was released in March 2018, which was six months after the release of JDK 9. The next release (JDK 11) was in September 2018. Again, it is anticipated that every six months a new feature release will take place. You will want to consult the Java documentation for latest release schedule information.</p>
                                        <p>At the time of this writing, there are a number of new Java features on the horizon. Because of the faster release schedule, it is very likely that several of them will be added to Java over the next few years. You will want to review the information and release notes provided by each six-month release in detail. It is truly an exciting time to be a Java programmer!</p>

                                <p>At the center of Java is object-oriented programming (OOP). The object-oriented methodology is inseparable from Java, and all Java programs are, to at least some extent, object-oriented. Because of OOP's importance to Java, it is useful to understand in a general way OOP's basic principles before you write even a simple Java program. Later in this book, you will see how to put these concepts into practice.</p>
                                <p>OOP is a powerful way to approach the job of programming. Programming methodologies have changed dramatically since the invention of the computer, primarily to accommodate the increasing complexity of programs. For example, when computers were first invented, programming was done by toggling in the binary machine instructions using the computer's front panel. As long as programs were just a few hundred instructions long, this approach worked. As programs grew, assembly language was invented so that a programmer could deal with larger, increasingly complex programs, using symbolic representations of the machine instructions. As programs continued to grow, high-level languages were introduced that gave the programmer more tools with which to handle complexity. The first widespread language was, of course, FORTRAN. Although FORTRAN was a very impressive first step, it was hardly a language that encouraged clear, easy-to-understand programs.</p>
                                <p>The 1960s gave birth to structured programming. This is the method encouraged by languages such as C and Pascal. The use of structured languages made it possible to write moderately complex programs fairly easily. Structured languages are characterized by their support for stand-alone subroutines, local variables, rich control constructs, and their lack of reliance upon the GOTO. Although structured languages are a powerful tool, even they reach their limit when a project becomes too large.</p>
                                <p>Consider this: At each milestone in the development of programming, techniques and tools were created to allow the programmer to deal with increasingly greater complexity. Each step of the way, the new approach took the best elements of the previous methods and moved forward. Prior to the invention of OOP, many projects were nearing (or exceeding) the point where the structured approach no longer works. Object-oriented methods were created to help programmers break through these barriers.</p>
                                <p>Object-oriented programming took the best ideas of structured programming and combined them with several new concepts. The result was a different way of organizing a program. In the most general sense, <span class="highlight">a program can be organized in one of two ways: around its code (what is happening) or around its data (what is being affected)</span>. Using only structured programming techniques, programs are typically organized around code. This approach can be thought of as "code acting on data."</p>
                                <p>Object-oriented programs work the other way around. <span class="highlight">They are organized around data, with the key principle being "data controlling access to code." In an object-oriented language, you define the data and the routines that are permitted to act on that data. Thus, a data type defines precisely what sort of operations can be applied to that data.</span></p>
                                <p>To support the principles of object-oriented programming, all OOP languages, including Java, have three traits in common: <em>encapsulation</em>, <em>polymorphism</em>, and <em>inheritance</em>. Let's examine each.</p>

                                        <p><em><i>Encapsulation</i> is a programming mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.</em> In an object-oriented language, code and data can be bound together in such a way that a self-contained <i>black box</i> is created. Within the box are all necessary data and code. When code and data are linked together in this fashion, an object is created. In other words, an object is the device that supports encapsulation.</p>
                                        <p>Within an object, code, data, or both may be <em><code>private</code> to that object</em> or <em><code>public</code></em>.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Private code or data is known to and accessible by only another part of the object. That is, private code or data cannot be accessed by a piece of the program that exists outside the object.</li>
                                            <li>When code or data is public, other parts of your program can access it even though it is defined within an object. Typically, the public parts of an object are used to provide a controlled interface to the private elements of the object.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Java's basic unit of encapsulation is the <em>class</em>. Although the class will be examined in great detail later in this book, the following brief discussion will be helpful now. A class defines the form of an object. It specifies both the data and the code that will operate on that data. Java uses a class specification to construct objects. Objects are instances of a class. Thus, a class is essentially a set of plans that specify how to build an object.</p>
                                        <p>The code and data that constitute a class are called <em>members of the class</em>. Specifically, the data defined by the class are referred to as <em>member variables</em> or <em>instance variables</em>. The code that operates on that data is referred to as <em></em>member methods</em> or just <em>methods</em>. Method is Java's term for a subroutine. If you are familiar with C/C++, it may help to know that what a Java programmer calls a method, a C/C++ programmer calls a function.</p>

                                    <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
                                </div>  <!-- left -->
                                <div class="right">

                                        <p><em><i>Polymorphism</i> (from Greek, meaning "many forms") is the quality that allows one interface to access a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.</em> A simple example of polymorphism is found in the steering wheel of an automobile. The steering wheel (i.e., the interface) is the same no matter what type of actual steering mechanism is used. That is, the steering wheel works the same whether your car has manual steering, power steering, or rack-and-pinion steering. Therefore, once you know how to operate the steering wheel, you can drive any type of car.</p>
                                        <p>The same principle can also apply to programming. For example, consider a stack (which is a first-in, last-out list). You might have a program that requires three different types of stacks. One stack is used for integer values, one for floating-point values, and one for characters. In this case, the algorithm that implements each stack is the same, even though the data being stored differs. In a non-object-oriented language, you would be required to create three different sets of stack routines, with each set using different names. However, because of polymorphism, in Java you can create one general set of stack routines that works for all three specific situations. This way, once you know how to use one stack, you can use them all.</p>
                                        <p>More generally, the concept of polymorphism is often expressed by the phrase "one interface, multiple methods." This means that it is possible to design a generic interface to a group of related activities. Polymorphism helps reduce complexity by allowing the same interface to be used to specify a <i>general class of action</i>. It is the compiler's job to select the <i>specific action</i> (i.e., method) as it applies to each situation. You, the programmer, don't need to do this selection manually. You need only remember and utilize the general interface.</p>

                                        <p><em><i>Inheritance</i> is the process by which one object can acquire the properties of another object.</em> This is important because it supports the concept of hierarchical classification. If you think about it, most knowledge is made manageable by hierarchical (i.e., top-down) classifications. For example, a Red Delicious apple is part of the classification <code>apple</code>, which in turn is part of the <code>fruit</code> class, which is under the larger class <code>food</code>. That is, the <code>food</code> class possesses certain qualities (edible, nutritious, etc.) which also, logically, apply to its subclass, <code>fruit</code>. In addition to these qualities, the <code>fruit</code> class has specific characteristics (juicy, sweet, etc.) that distinguish it from other food. The <code>apple</code> class defines those qualities specific to an apple (grows on trees, not tropical, etc.). A Red Delicious apple would, in turn, inherit all the qualities of all preceding classes, and would define only those qualities that make it unique.</p>
                                        <p>Without the use of hierarchies, each object would have to explicitly define all of its characteristics. Using inheritance, an object need only define those qualities that make it unique within its class. It can inherit its general attributes from its parent. Thus, it is the inheritance mechanism that makes it possible for one object to be a specific instance of a more general case.</p>

                                <p>Now that the theoretical underpinning of Java has been explained, it is time to start writing Java programs. Before you can compile and run those programs, you must have a Java Development Kit (JDK). At the time of this writing, the current release of the JDK is JDK 11. This is the version for Java SE 11. (SE stands for Standard Edition.) It is also the version described in this book. Because JDK 11 contains features that are not supported by earlier versions of Java, it is recommended that you use JDK 11 (or later) to compile and run the programs in this book. (Remember, because of Java's faster release schedule, JDK feature releases are expected at six-month intervals. Thus, don't be surprised by a JDK with a higher release number.) However, depending on the environment in which you are working, an earlier JDK may already be installed. If this is the case, then newer Java features will not be available.</p>
                                <p>If you need to install the JDK on your computer, be aware that for modern versions of Java, both Oracle JDKs and open source OpenJDKs are available for download. In general, you should first find the JDK you want to use. For example, at the time of this writing, the Oracle JDK can be downloaded from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>. Also at the time of this writing, an open source version is available at <a target="_blank" href="https://jdk.java.net/">jdk.java.net</a>. Next, download the JDK of your choice and follow its instructions to install it on your computer. After you have installed the JDK, you will be able to compile and run programs.</p>
                                <p>The JDK supplies two primary programs.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The first is <code>javac</code>, which is the Java compiler.</li>
                                    <li>The second is <code>java</code>, which is the standard Java interpreter and is also referred to as the <i>application launcher</i>.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>One other point: The JDK runs in the command-prompt environment and uses command-line tools. It is not a windowed application. It is also not an integrated development environment (IDE).</p>

                                <p>In addition to the basic command-line tools supplied with the JDK, there are several high-quality IDEs available for Java, such as <i>NetBeans</i> and <i>Eclipse</i>. An IDE can be very helpful when developing and deploying commercial applications. As a general rule, you can also use an IDE to compile and run the programs in this book if you so choose. However, the instructions presented in this book for compiling and running a Java program describe only the JDK command-line tools. The reasons for this are easy to understand. First, the JDK is readily available to all readers. Second, the instructions for using the JDK will be the same for all readers. Furthermore, for the simple programs presented in this book, using the JDK command-line tools is usually the easiest approach. If you are using an IDE, you will need to follow its instructions. Because of differences between IDEs, no general set of instructions can be given.</p>

                                <p class="question">You state that object-oriented programming is an effective way to manage large programs. However, it seems that it might add substantial overhead to relatively small ones. Since you say that all Java programs are, to some extent, object-oriented, does this impose a penalty for smaller programs?</p>
                                <p class="answer">No. As you will see, for small programs, Java's object-oriented features are nearly transparent. Although it is true that Java follows a strict object model, you have wide latitude as to the degree to which you employ it. For smaller programs, their "object-orientedness" is barely perceptible. As your programs grow, you will integrate more object-oriented features effortlessly.</p>

However, if you want to enter the programs by hand, you are free to do so. In this case, you must enter the program into your computer using a text editor, not a word processor. Word processors typically store format information along with text. This format information will confuse the Java compiler. If you are using a Windows platform, you can use WordPad or any other programming editor that you like.</p>
                                        <p>For most computer languages, the name of the file that holds the source code to a program is arbitrary. However, this is not the case with Java. The first thing that you must learn about Java is that <em>the name you give to a source file is very important</em>. For this example, the name of the source file should be <code>Example.java</code>. Let's see why.</p>
                                        <p>In Java, a source file is officially called a <em>compilation unit</em>. It is a text file that contains (among other things) one or more class definitions. (For now, we will be using source files that contain only one class.) The Java compiler requires that a source file use the <code>.java</code> filename extension. As you can see by looking at the program, the name of the class defined by the program is also <code>Example</code>. This is not a coincidence. In Java, all code must reside inside a class. By convention, the name of the main class should match the name of the file that holds the program. You should also make sure that the capitalization of the filename matches the class name. The reason for this is that Java is case sensitive. At this point, the convention that filenames correspond to class names may seem arbitrary. However, this convention makes it easier to maintain and organize your programs. Furthermore, as you will see later in this book, in some cases, it is required.</p>

                                </div>  <!-- left -->
                                <div class="right">

                                        <p>To compile the <code>Example</code> program, execute the compiler, <code>javac</code>, specifying the name of the source file on the command line, as shown here:</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext">javac Example.java</code></pre>  <!-- plaintext block -->
                                        <p>The <code>javac</code> compiler creates a file called <code>Example.class</code> that contains the bytecode version of the program. Remember, <em>bytecode is not executable code</em>. Bytecode must be executed by a Java Virtual Machine. Thus, the output of <code>javac</code> is not code that can be directly executed.</p>
                                        <p>To actually run the program, you must use the Java interpreter, <code>java</code>. To do so, pass the class name <code>Example</code> as a command-line argument, as shown here:</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext">java Example</code></pre>  <!-- plaintext block -->
                                        <p>When the program is run, the following output is displayed:</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext">Java drives the web.</code></pre>  <!-- plaintext block -->
                                        <p>When Java source code is compiled, each individual class is put into its own output file named after the class and using the <code>.class</code> extension. This is why it is a good idea to give your Java source files the same name as the class they contain—the name of the source file will match the name of the <code>.class</code> file. When you execute the Java interpreter as just shown, you are actually specifying the name of the class that you want the interpreter to execute. It will automatically search for a file by that name that has the <code>.class</code> extension. If it finds the file, it will execute the code contained in the specified class.</p>
                                        <p>Before moving on, it is important to mention that beginning with JDK 11, Java provides a way to run some types of simple programs directly from a source file, without explicitly invoking <code>javac</code>. This technique, which can be useful in some situations, is described in Appendix C. For the purposes of this book, it is assumed that you are using the normal compilation process just described.</p>

                                        <p>If, when you try to compile the program, the computer cannot find <code>javac</code> (and assuming that you have installed the JDK correctly), you may need to specify the path to the command-line tools. In Windows, for example, this means that you will need to add the path to the command-line tools to the paths defined for the <code>PATH</code> environmental variable. For example, if JDK 11 was installed under the Program Files directory, then the path to the command-line tools will be similar to <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11\bin</code>. (Of course, you will need to find the path to Java on your computer, which may differ from the one just shown. Also the specific version of the JDK may differ.) You will need to consult the documentation for your operating system on how to set the path, because this procedure differs between OSes.</p>

                                </div>  <!-- left -->
                                <div class="right">
                                    <div class="content">
                                        <p>Although <code>Example.java</code> is quite short, it includes several key features that are common to all Java programs. Let's closely examine each part of the program.</p>
                                        <p>The program begins with the following lines:</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-java">/*
   This is a simple java program.
   
   Call this file Example.java
*/</code></pre>
                                        <p>This is a <i>comment</i>. Like most other programming languages, Java lets you enter a remark into a program's source file. The contents of a comment are ignored by the compiler. Instead, a comment describes or explains the operation of the program to anyone who is reading its source code. In this case, the comment describes the program and reminds you that the source file should be called <code>Example.java</code>. Of course, in real applications, comments generally explain how some part of the program works or what a specific feature does.</p>
                                        <p>Java supports three styles of comments. The one shown at the top of the program is called a <em>multiline comment</em>. This type of comment must begin with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>. Anything between these two comment symbols is ignored by the compiler. As the name suggests, a multiline comment may be several lines long.</p>
                                        <p>The next line of code in the program is shown here:</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-java">class Example {</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                        <p>This line uses the keyword <code>class</code> to declare that a new class is being defined. As mentioned, the class is Java's basic unit of encapsulation. <code>Example</code> is the name of the class. The class definition begins with the opening curly brace (<code>{</code>) and ends with the closing curly brace (<code>}</code>). The elements between the two braces are members of the class. For the moment, don't worry too much about the details of a class except to note that in Java, all program activity occurs within one. This is one reason why all Java programs are (at least a little bit) object-oriented.</p>
                                        <p>The next line in the program is the <em>single-line comment</em>, shown here:</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-java">// A Java program begins with a call to main().</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                        <p>This is the second type of comment supported by Java. A single-line comment begins with a <code>//</code> and ends at the end of the line. As a general rule, programmers use multiline comments for longer remarks and single-line comments for brief, line-by-line descriptions.</p>
                                        <p>The next line of code is shown here:</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String args[]) {</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                        <p>This line begins the <code>main()</code> method. As mentioned earlier, in Java, a subroutine is called a method. As the comment preceding it suggests, this is the line at which the program will begin executing. In general, Java applications begin execution by calling <code>main()</code>. The exact meaning of each part of this line cannot be given now, since it involves a detailed understanding of several other of Java's features. However, since many of the examples in this book will use this line of code, let's take a brief look at each part now.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The <code>public</code> keyword is an <em>access modifier</em>. An access modifier determines how other parts of the program can access the members of the class. When a class member is preceded by <code>public</code>, then that member can be accessed by code outside the class in which it is declared. (The opposite of <code>public</code> is <code>private</code>, which prevents a member from being used by code defined outside of its class.) In this case, <code>main()</code> must be declared as <code>public</code>, since it must be called by code outside of its class when the program is started.</li>
                                            <li><em>The keyword <code>static</code> allows <code>main()</code> to be called before an object of the class has been created. This is necessary because <code>main()</code> is called by the JVM before any objects are made.</em></li>
                                            <li>The keyword <code>void</code> simply tells the compiler that <code>main()</code> does not return a value. As you will see, methods may also return values.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>If all this seems a bit confusing, don't worry. All of these concepts will be discussed in detail in subsequent chapters.</p>
                                        <p>As stated, <code>main()</code> is the method called when a Java application begins. Any information that you need to pass to a method is received by variables specified within the set of parentheses that follow the name of the method. These variables are called <em>parameters</em>. If no parameters are required for a given method, you still need to include the empty parentheses. In <code>main()</code> there is only one parameter, <code>String args[]</code>, which declares a parameter named <code>args</code>. This is an array of objects of type <code>String</code>. (Arrays are collections of similar objects.) Objects of type <code>String</code> store sequences of characters. In this case, <code>args</code> receives any command-line arguments present when the program is executed. This program does not make use of this information, but other programs shown later in this book will.</p>
                                        <p>The last character on the line is the <code>{</code>. This signals the start of <code>main()</code>'s body. All of the code included in a method will occur between the method's opening curly brace and its closing curly brace.</p>
                                        <p>The next line of code is shown here. Notice that it occurs inside <code>main()</code>.</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("Java drives the web.");</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                        <p>This line outputs the string <code>"Java drives the Web."</code> followed by a new line on the screen. Output is actually accomplished by the built-in <code>println()</code> method. In this case, <code>println()</code> displays the string that is passed to it. As you will see, <code>println()</code> can be used to display other types of information, too. The line begins with <code>System.out</code>. While too complicated to explain in detail at this time, briefly, <code>System</code> is a predefined class that provides access to the system, and <code>out</code> is the output stream that is connected to the <em>console</em>. Thus, <code>System.out</code> is an object that encapsulates console output. The fact that Java uses an object to define console output is further evidence of its object-oriented nature.</p>
                                        <p>As you have probably guessed, <em>console output (and input) is not used frequently in real-world Java applications</em>. Since most modern computing environments are windowed and graphical in nature, <em>console I/O is used mostly for simple utility programs, for demonstration programs, and for server-side code</em>. Later in this book, you will learn other ways to generate output using Java, but for now, we will continue to use the console I/O methods.</p>
                                        <p>Notice that the <code>println()</code> statement ends with a semicolon. Many statements in Java end with a semicolon. As you will see, the semicolon is an important part of the Java syntax.</p>
                                        <p>The first <code>}</code> in the program ends <code>main()</code>, and the last <code>}</code> ends the <code>Example</code> class definition.</p>
                                        <p>One last point: <em>Java is case sensitive</em>. Forgetting this can cause you serious problems. For example, if you accidentally type <code>Main</code> instead of <code>main</code>, or <code>PrintLn</code> instead of <code>println</code>, the preceding program will be incorrect. Furthermore, although the Java compiler will compile classes that do not contain a <code>main()</code> method, it has no way to execute them. So, if you had mistyped <code>main</code>, the compiler would still compile your program. However, the Java interpreter would report an error because it would be unable to find the <code>main()</code> method.</p>

                                <p>If you have not yet done so, enter, compile, and run the preceding program. As you may know from your previous programming experience, it is quite easy to accidentally type something incorrectly when entering code into your computer. Fortunately, if you enter something incorrectly into your program, the compiler will report a syntax error message when it tries to compile it. The Java compiler attempts to make sense out of your source code no matter what you have written. For this reason, the error that is reported may not always reflect the actual cause of the problem. In the preceding program, for example, an accidental omission of the opening curly brace after the <code>main()</code> method causes the compiler to report the following two errors:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-plaintext">Example.java:8: ';' expected
  public static void main(String args[])
                                        ^

                                <p>Clearly, the first error message is completely wrong because what is missing is not a semicolon, but a curly brace.</p>
                                <p>The point of this discussion is that when your program contains a syntax error, you shouldn't necessarily take the compiler's messages at face value. The messages may be misleading. You may need to "second-guess" an error message in order to find the real problem. Also, look at the last few lines of code in your program that precede the line being flagged. Sometimes an error will not be reported until several lines after the point at which the error actually occurred.</p>

Further, <span class="highlight">the value of a variable can be changed during the execution of a program</span>. That is, the content of a variable is changeable, not fixed. The following program creates two variables called <code>myVar1</code> and <code>myVar2</code>:</p>

                                <p>When you run this program, you will see the following output:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-plaintext">myVar1 contains: 1024

                                <p>This program introduces several new concepts. First, the statement</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-java">int myVar1;  // this declares a variable</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                <p>declares a variable called <code>myVar1</code> of type integer. In Java, all variables must be declared before they are used. Further, the type of values that the variable can hold must also be specified. This is called the <em>type of the variable</em>. In this case, <code>myVar1</code> can hold integer values. These are whole number values. In Java, to declare a variable to be of type integer, precede its name with the keyword <code>int</code>. Thus, the preceding statement declares a variable called <code>myVar1</code> of type <code>int</code>.</p>
                                <p>The next line declares a second variable called <code>myVar2</code>:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-java">int myVar2;  // this declares another variable</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                <p>Notice that this line uses the same format as the first line except that the name of the variable is different.</p>
                                <p>In general, to declare a variable you will use a statement like this:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-plaintext">type var-name;</code></pre>  <!-- plaintext block -->
                                <p>Here, <i>type</i> specifies the type of variable being declared, and <i>var-name</i> is the name of the variable. In addition to <code>int</code>, Java supports several other data types.</p>
                                <p>The following line of code assigns <code>myVar1</code> the value 1024:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-java">myVar1 = 1024; // this assigns 1024 to myVar1</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                <p>In Java, the assignment operator is the single equal sign. It copies the value on its right side into the variable on its left.</p>
                                <p>The next line of code outputs the value of <code>myVar1</code> preceded by the string <code>"myVar1 contains "</code>:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println("myVar1 contains: " + myVar1);</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                <p>In this statement, the plus sign causes the value of <code>myVar1</code> to be displayed after the string that precedes it. This approach can be generalized. Using the <code>+</code> operator, you can chain together as many items as you want within a single <code>println()</code> statement.</p>
                                <p>The next line of code assigns <code>myVar2</code> the value of <code>myVar1</code> divided by 2:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-java">myVar2 = myVar1 / 2;</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                <p>This line divides the value in <code>myVar1</code> by 2 and then stores that result in <code>myVar2</code>. Thus, after the line executes, <code>myVar2</code> will contain the value 512. The value of <code>myVar1</code> will be unchanged. Like most other computer languages, Java supports a full range of arithmetic operators, including those shown here:</p>

                                <p>Here are the next two lines in the program:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-java">System.out.print("myVar2 contains myVar1 / 2: ");
System.err.println(myVar2);</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                <p>Two new things are occurring here. First, the built-in method <code>print()</code> is used to display the string <code>"myVar2 contains myVar1 / 2: "</code>. This string is not followed by a new line. This means that when the next output is generated, it will start on the same line. The <code>print()</code> method is just like <code>println()</code>, except that it does not output a new line after each call. Second, in the call to <code>println()</code>, notice that <code>myVar2</code> is used by itself. Both <code>print()</code> and <code>println()</code> can be used to output values of any of Java's built-in types.</p>
                                <p>One more point about declaring variables before we move on: It is possible to declare two or more variables using the same declaration statement. Just separate their names by commas. For example, <code>myVar1</code> and <code>myVar2</code> could have been declared like this:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-java">int myVar1, myVar2; // both declared using one statement</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->

                                <p>In the preceding program, a variable of type <code>int</code> was used. However, a variable of type <code>int</code> can hold only whole numbers. Thus, it cannot be used when a fractional component is required. For example, an <code>int</code> variable can hold the value 18, but not the value 18.3. Fortunately, <code>int</code> is only one of several data types defined by Java. To allow numbers with fractional components, Java defines two floating-point types: <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>, which represent single- and double-precision values, respectively. Of the two, <code>double</code> is the most commonly used.</p>
                                <p>To declare a variable of type <code>double</code>, use a statement similar to that shown here:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-java">double x;</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                <p>Here, <code>x</code> is the name of the variable, which is of type <code>double</code>. Because <code>x</code> has a floating-point type, it can hold values such as 122.23, 0.034, or -19.0.</p>
                                <p>To better understand the difference between int and double, try the following program:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-java">/**
 * This program illustrates the differences 
 * between int and double.

        v = 10;  // Assign v the value 10.

        x = 10.0;  // Assign x the value 10.0.

        System.out.println("Original value of v: " + v);
        System.out.println("Original value of x: " + x);
        System.out.println();  // Print a blank line.

        // Now, divide both by 4.
        v = v / 4;
        x = x / 4;

        System.out.println("v after division: " + v);
        System.out.println("x after division: " + x);
    }
}</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                <p>The output from this program is shown here:</p>
                                <pre><code class="language-plaintext">Original value of v: 10

                                <p>As you can see, when <code>v</code> is divided by 4, a whole-number division is performed, and the outcome is 2—the fractional component is lost. However, when the <code>double</code> variable <code>x</code> is divided by 4, the fractional component is preserved, and the proper answer is displayed.</p>
                                <p>There is one other new thing to notice in the program. To print a blank line, simply call <code>println()</code> without any arguments.</p>

                                <p class="question">Why does Java have different data types for integers and floating-point values? That is, why aren't all numeric values just the same type?</p>
                                <p class="answer">Java supplies different data types so that you can write efficient programs. For example, integer arithmetic is faster than floating-point calculations. Thus, if you don't need fractional values, then you don't need to incur the overhead associated with types <code>float</code> or <code>double</code>. Second, the amount of memory required for one type of data might be less than that required for another. By supplying different types, Java enables you to make best use of system resources. Finally, some algorithms require (or at least benefit from) the use of a specific type of data. In general, Java supplies a number of built-in types to give you the greatest flexibility.</p>

                                <p>Although the preceding sample programs illustrate several important features of the Java language, they are not very useful. Even though you do not know much about Java at this point, you can still put what you have learned to work to create a practical program. In this project, we will create a program that converts gallons to liters. The program will work by declaring two <code>double</code> variables. One will hold the number of the gallons, and the second will hold the number of liters after the conversion. There are 3.7854 liters in a gallon. Thus, to convert gallons to liters, the gallon value is multiplied by 3.7854. The program displays both the number of gallons and the equivalent number of liters.</p>

                                        <p>You can selectively execute part of a program through the use of Java's conditional statement: the <code>if</code>. The Java <code>if</code> statement works much like the IF statement in any other language. It determines the flow of program execution based on whether some condition is true or false. Its simplest form is shown here:</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-plaintext">if(condition) statement;</code></pre>  <!-- plaintext block -->
                                        <p>Here, <i>condition</i> is a Boolean expression. (A Boolean expression is one that evaluates to either true or false.) If <i>condition</i> is true, then the statement is executed. If <i>condition</i> is false, then the statement is bypassed. Here is an example:</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-java">if(10 < 11) System.out.println("10 is less than 11");</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                        <p>In this case, since 10 is less than 11, the conditional expression is true, and <code>println()</code> will execute. However, consider the following:</p>
                                        <pre><code class="language-java">if(10 < 9) System.out.prinln("this won't be displayed");</code></pre>  <!-- java code -->
                                        <p>In this case, 10 is not less than 9. Thus, the call to <code>println()</code> will not take place.</p>
                                        <p>Java defines a full complement of <em>relational operators</em> that may be used in a conditional expression. They are shown here:</p>
