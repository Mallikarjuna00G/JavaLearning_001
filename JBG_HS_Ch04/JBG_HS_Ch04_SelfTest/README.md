### SelfTest Problem

How is a class defined?

### SelfTest Problem

What does each object have its own copy of?

### SelfTest Solution

Each object of a class has its own copy of the class’ instance variables.

## SelfTest04

### SelfTest Problem

Using two separate statements, show how to declare an object called `counter` of a class called `MyCounter`.

### SelfTest Solution

```java
MyCounter counter;
counter = new MyCounter();
```

---

## SelfTest05

### SelfTest Problem

Show how a method called `myMeth()` is declared if it has a return type of `double` and has two `int` parameters called `a` and `b`.

### SelfTest Solution

```java
double myMeth(int a, int b) {
    // do something
}
```

## SelfTest06

### SelfTest Problem

How must a method return if it returns a value?

### SelfTest Solution

A method that returns a value must return via the `return` statement, passing back the return value in the process.

What name does a constructor have?

### SelfTest Solution

A constructor has the same name as its class.

---

## SelfTest08

### SelfTest Problem

What does `new` do?

### SelfTest Solution

The `new` operator allocates memory for an object and initializes it using the object’s constructor.

---

## SelfTest09

### SelfTest Problem

What is garbage collection, and how does it work?

### SelfTest Solution

Garbage collection is the mechanism that recycles unused objects so that their memory can be reused.

---

## SelfTest10

### SelfTest Problem

What is `this`?

### SelfTest Solution

The `this` keyword is a reference to the object on which a method is invoked. It is automatically passed to a method.

---

## SelfTest11

### SelfTest Problem

Can a constructor have one or more parameters?
