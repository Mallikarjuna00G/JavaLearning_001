AAA

#### Execution Logs

```

```

---

## SelfTest13

### SelfTest Problem

Rewrite the `MinMax` class shown earlier in this chapter so that it uses a for-­each style `for` loop.

### SelfTest Solution

#### Programs:

[]()

AAA

#### Execution Logs

```

```

---

## SelfTest14

### SelfTest Problem

Can the `for` loops that perform sorting in the `Bubble` class shown in `Try This 5­-1` be converted into for-­each style loops? If not, why not?

### SelfTest Solution

#### Programs:

[]()

AAA

#### Execution Logs

```

```

---

## SelfTest15

### SelfTest Problem

Can a `String` control a `switch` statement?

### SelfTest Solution

#### Programs:

[]()

AAA

#### Execution Logs

### SelfTest Solution

#### Programs:

[]()

AAA

#### Execution Logs

```

```

---

## SelfTest17

### SelfTest Problem

Show how to use local variable type inference to declare a `boolean` variable called `done` that has an initial value of `false`.

### SelfTest Solution

#### Programs:

[]()

AAA

#### Execution Logs

```

```

---

## SelfTest18

### SelfTest Problem

```

---

## SelfTest19

### SelfTest Problem

```

### SelfTest Solution

#### Programs:

[]()

AAA

#### Execution Logs

```

```

---

## SelfTest20

### SelfTest Problem

```

### SelfTest Solution

#### Programs:

[]()

AAA

#### Execution Logs

```

---

## SelfTest21

### SelfTest Problem

In the `show()` method of the `ShowBits` class developed in `Try This 5­-3`, the local variable mask is declared as shown here:

```java
long mask = 1;
```

Change this declaration so that it uses local variable type inference. When doing so, be sure that `mask` is of type `long` (as it is here), and not of type `int`.
